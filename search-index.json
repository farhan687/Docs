If you were to do so, the data that had already been indexed would be incorrect and your searches would no longer work as expected. Here’s a short gist on how mappings work:</p><p>In order to make your data searchable, your database needs to know what type of data each field contains and how it should be indexed. If you switch a field type from e.g. a string to a date, all of the data for that field that you already have indexed cannot be used because of the datatype mismatch. In such situations, you need to reindex that field.</p><p>This applies not just to Appbase (or Elasticsearch / Lucene - the datastore used by Appbase), but to any database that uses indices for searching. And if it isn’t using indices then it is sacrificing speed for flexibility.</p><p>There is one situation where re-indexing is not required: when adding a field, as a previous mapping for the field didn’t exist and Appbase can infer the field datatype when it’s indexed for the first time.</p><p>Since updating mapping =&gt; reindexing data, let’s take a look at that.</p>","link":"./scalr/FAQs/rest.html","spaLink":"#/scalr/FAQs/rest","title":"UPDATE MAPPING WITHOUT LOSING DATA"},{"content":"<h3 id=\"how-to-update-mapping-without-losing-data-reindexing-your-data\">Reindexing your data</h3><p>The process for reindexing your data is quite simple.
